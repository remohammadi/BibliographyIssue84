= Centralization of the Internet and the Role of Mobile Platforms
Reza Mohammadi Ghayeghchi

== Centralization of the Internet

// early years and the distributed world of Internet
The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET),
an early network connecting many major universities and
research institutions in the USA,
was first demonstrated publicly in October 1972
cite:[roberts_arpanet_1986, page=3].
It was initially funded by the United States
Department of Defense during the cold war as a part of
"the command and control assignment" of the ARPA program
cite:[lukasik_why_2011, page=10].
The ((ARPANET)) was designed to be "as distributed as possible,"
because its routing algorithm was adapted from an article by Paul Baran,
written at the time he was at the RAND Corporation researching
on highly survivable communication networks "in the thermonuclear era"
cite:[baran_distributed_1964, page=18].
With the support of the US National Science Foundation, ARPANET gradually
"evolved into a commercial, worldwide open network" -- the Internet
